### What's Growing in the Garden?

This project is a vibrant showcase of web development fundamentals. The core of our garden is the **`index.html`** file, which acts as the main plot where all the different sections of the portfolio—from "About Me" to "Projects"—are laid out. The visual appeal is brought to life by the **`assets/`** directory, our virtual greenhouse. Inside, you'll find the **`css/`** folder containing style sheets like `bootstrap.min.css` and `main.css`, which are the magic fertilizers that make the site look beautiful and responsive on any device. The **`images/`** folder holds the visual flora, including Luka's photo and snapshots of his projects, while the **`js/`** folder contains the active scripts, powered by jQuery and Bootstrap, that ensure a smooth and interactive experience. Lastly, the **`Luka Jessel Curriculum Vitae.pdf`** is the detailed ledger of all the growth and achievements.
